# Hello, World! :smiley:
My name is Brian Mohammed Catraguna. I am 21 years old. I am a 4th year Aerospace Engineering student and I love to solve coding problems. I recently just got into the machine learning world and have been interested ever since. I code in Python, C++, and MATLAB.

Beside programming, I like to:
- Travel! :airplane:
- Rockin' the guitar :notes:
- Skateboarding :snowboarder:
- Hiking mountains! :mount_fuji:
