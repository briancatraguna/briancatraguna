# Hello, World! :smiley:
My name is Brian Mohammed Catraguna. I am 21 years old. I am a 4th year Aerospace Engineering student and I love to solve coding problems. I recently just got into the machine learning world and have been interested ever since. My go - to coding language when I try to make my ideas come true quick is Python!

Beside programming, I like to:
